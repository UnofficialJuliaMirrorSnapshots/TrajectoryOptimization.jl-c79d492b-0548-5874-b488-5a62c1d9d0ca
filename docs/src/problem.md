The [Problem](@ref) type represents the trajectory optimization problem to be solved, which consists of the following information:

* Dynamics model: the system that is being controlled, specified by differential or difference equations.
* Objective: a collection of CostFunction's to be minimized of the form ``\ell_N(x_N) + \sum_{k=0}^N \ell(x_k,u_k)``
* Constraints: Optional stage wise constraints of the form ``c_k(x_k,u_k)`` or ``c_N(x_N)``.
* Initial state: all trajectory optimization algorithms require the initial state.
* N: the number of knot points (or number of discretization points)
* dt: the time step used for discretizing the continuous dynamics
* tf: the total duration of the trajectory

The [Problem](@ref) type also stores the nominal state and control input trajectories (i.e. the primal variables).

## Creating a Problem
A problem is typically created using the following constructors

```@docs
Problem(model::Model,cost::CostFunction,x0::Vector{T},U::VectorTrajectory{T},dt::T) where T
Problem(model::Model,cost::CostFunction,x0::Vector{T},U::Matrix{T},dt::T) where T
```
where `U` is either an n Ã— N-1 matrix or a vector of n-dimensional vectors (VectorTrajectory). A bare-minimum constructor is also available

```@docs
Problem(model::Model,cost::CostFunction,N::Int,dt::T) where T
```
which initializes the initial state and the control input trajectory to zeros.

The inner constructor can also be used with caution.
```@docs
Problem(model::Model, cost::CostFunction, constraints::ConstraintSet,
      x0::Vector{T}, X::VectorTrajectory, U::VectorTrajectory, N::Int, dt::T) where T
```

## Adding constraints
A constraint can be added once the problem is created using

```@docs
add_constraints
```
